### ToDo
### please edit that readme as you want and write what i suggest below.
[] Please write steps to setup the project and needed packages. ex node version
   - node version
   - emulator ABI and type/screen
   - simulator type
   - steps to configure the emulator in the app capabilities
   - add application apk,ipa that will be used while installing app on emulator/simualator.

[] written test case doesn't assert any requirements or behavior.
   - we need to write a mocha test case that represents what we need to assert
   ex
    ```
    it('should validate successful user login message appears when user enters valid credentials', () => {
        // login()
        // assert.equal(element.text(),'welcome')
    })
    ```
